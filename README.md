# Statistical Methods for Data Analysis in Cosmology

## 📄 Abstract
This project presents a detailed study and application of key statistical techniques essential for cosmological data analysis. Conducted as part of a Summer Internship at the **DS Kothari Research Centre, Miranda House**, this project utilizes Python to analyze cosmological data, providing insights into underlying physical processes.

## 🛠️ Methodologies Implemented
This repository contains the analysis for the following statistical techniques as outlined in our project report:

### 1. Monte Carlo Simulations
Used for generating random samples to understand the probabilistic nature of cosmological phenomena.
* **Key Applications:** Estimating the value of $\pi$ and the "Sphere in a Cube" simulation.
* **Cosmological Context:** Modeling large-scale structures and galaxy distributions.

### 2. Bayesian Inference
Applied to update the probability estimates of hypotheses based on observational data.
* **Formula:** Utilizes Bayes' Theorem $P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}$ to update beliefs about models given new data.

### 3. Chi-Square Fitting
Utilized for assessing the goodness of fit between theoretical models and observed data.
* **Statistic:** $\chi^{2}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{(O_{i}-E_{i})^{2}}{E_{i}}$.
* **Application:** Fitting the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ against Redshift $z$ to estimate parameters like $\Omega_m$.

### 4. Likelihood Analysis
Implemented to estimate parameters of cosmological models by maximizing the likelihood function $\mathcal{L}(\theta|x)$.

### 5. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
Employed to sample from complex probability distributions for parameter estimation.
* **Results:** Estimation of Hubble constant ($H_0$) and Matter Density ($\Omega_m$).
